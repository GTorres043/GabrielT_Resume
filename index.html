  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p id="comment">"Hi, my name is Gabriel Torres and I am a student currently enrolled in the west-mec coding program.
    In the
    duration of the two
    years, I will first begin learning the computer language, "HTML5" and "CSS3" then continue on to learning
    "Javascript" and more."</p>

  <h2>My Life</h2>
  <p>I grew up in Central Phoenix, Arizona being the first child in the family. I moved around alot because of money
    issues but I am happy to say I have found a place to call home on the west side of Phoenix.
    Currently I have 4 younger sibling (3 boys 1 girl) in my family. I am fluent in both spanish and english, spanish
    being my first language. The highschool I am currently in is Tolleson Union highschool. I'm in my junior year and
    on my way to graduating. </p>
  <h2>Personality and Hobbies</h2>
  <p>I like to think of myself as a very kind hardworking person.</p>
